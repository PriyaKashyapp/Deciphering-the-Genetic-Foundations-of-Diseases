# Deciphering-the-Genetic-Foundations-of-Diseases
This project focuses on understanding the complex interplay between genes and diseases through network analysis, utilizing the "Diseasome" dataset. By mapping the relationships between genetic disorders and disease genes, we explore disease comorbidity and identify potential therapeutic targets.
